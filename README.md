# ToDo-with-Python-Tkinter

I had two things in mind creating this project.

1. I want to get more exposure to python and do more things with then just small stuff that I did until now.
2. I want to expose myself more to criticism. I am in the so called tutorial purgatory for too long.

I have now slightly more time on my hands which should give me the chance to program two to three times a week. I hope this will be enough.
